Hey there! üëã This is an **unofficial** PHP/Laravel SDK for the [SharpSports API](https://docs.sharpsports.io/). Threw this together in a few hours because I needed it for a project. It works pretty well, but you know... it's not perfect.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is **NOT** an official SharpSports product. I'm just some dev who needed to integrate their API. Use at your own risk! If something breaks, don't blame me (or SharpSports). If you find bugs, just open an issue or better yet, submit a PR!

## Features

- ‚úÖ Covers most (all?) SharpSports API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Laravel service provider and facade (fancy!)
- ‚úÖ Model classes that make sense
- ‚úÖ Handles those weird API responses pretty well
- ‚úÖ Error handling that actually works
- ‚úÖ Probably won't break your app (no promises though)

## Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require bitmicrosys/sharpsports-php
```

### Laravel Auto-Discovery

The package supports Laravel's auto-discovery feature. If you're using Laravel 5.5+, the service provider and facade will be automatically registered.

### Manual Registration (Laravel < 5.5)

Add the service provider to your `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Bitmicrosys\SharpsportsPhp\SharpsportsServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Add the facade to your `config/app.php`:

```php
'aliases' => [
    // ...
    'SharpSports' => Bitmicrosys\SharpsportsPhp\Facades\SharpSports::class,
],
```

## Configuration

Publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=sharpsports-config
```

Add your SharpSports API key to your `.env` file:

```env
SHARPSPORTS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```php
use Bitmicrosys\SharpsportsPhp\SharpSports;

// Initialize the client
$sharpSports = new SharpSports('your_api_key');

// Get all books
$books = $sharpSports->books()->list();

// Get active books only
$activeBooks = $sharpSports->books()->getActive();
```

### Using Laravel Facade

```php
use SharpSports;

// Get all books
$books = SharpSports::books()->list();

// Get a specific book
$book = SharpSports::books()->find('BOOK_pPg9ABaPSj2mL6qoMTKR1A');

// Get bettors
$bettors = SharpSports::bettors()->list();

// Get bet slips for a bettor
$betSlips = SharpSports::betSlips()->getByBettor('bettor_id');
```

### Using Dependency Injection

```php
use Bitmicrosys\SharpsportsPhp\SharpSports;

class BettingController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(private SharpSports $sharpSports)
    {
        //
    }

    public function getBooks()
    {
        return $this->sharpSports->books()->getActive();
    }
}
```

## Complete API Coverage

The SharpSports PHP SDK provides comprehensive coverage of all SharpSports API endpoints:

### Books
```php
// Get all books
$books = $sharpSports->books()->list();

// Get active books
$activeBooks = $sharpSports->books()->getActive();

// Get books that require SDK
$sdkBooks = $sharpSports->books()->getSdkRequired();

// Find a specific book
$book = $sharpSports->books()->find('BOOK_ID');
```

### Bettors
```php
// Get all bettors
$bettors = $sharpSports->bettors()->list();

// Get bettor details
$bettor = $sharpSports->bettors()->get('bettor_id');

// Get bettor metadata
$metadata = $sharpSports->bettors()->getMetadata('bettor_id');

// Refresh bettor data
$response = $sharpSports->bettors()->refresh('bettor_id');
```

### Bettor Accounts
```php
// Get all bettor accounts
$accounts = $sharpSports->bettorAccounts()->list();

// Get accounts for a specific bettor
$accounts = $sharpSports->bettorAccounts()->getByBettor('bettor_id');

// Refresh an account
$response = $sharpSports->bettorAccounts()->refresh('account_id');

// Pause an account
$response = $sharpSports->bettorAccounts()->pause('account_id');
```

### Bet Slips
```php
// Get all bet slips
$betSlips = $sharpSports->betSlips()->list();

// Get bet slips for a bettor
$betSlips = $sharpSports->betSlips()->getByBettor('bettor_id');

// Get bet slips for an account
$betSlips = $sharpSports->betSlips()->getByBettorAccount('account_id');

// Check bet slip availability
$availability = $sharpSports->betSlips()->checkAvailability($data);
```

### Context Operations
```php
// Sync bets
$response = $sharpSports->context()->betSync($data);

// Place bets
$response = $sharpSports->context()->betPlace($data);

// Get best price
$response = $sharpSports->context()->bestPrice($data);
```

### Events, Markets, Sports, etc.
```php
// Events
$events = $sharpSports->events()->list();
$event = $sharpSports->events()->get('event_id');

// Markets
$markets = $sharpSports->markets()->list();
$market = $sharpSports->markets()->get('market_id');

// Sports
$sports = $sharpSports->sports()->list();
$sport = $sharpSports->sports()->get('sport_id');

// Leagues
$leagues = $sharpSports->leagues()->list();

// Teams
$teams = $sharpSports->teams()->list();

// Players
$players = $sharpSports->players()->list();
```

### Webhooks
```php
// Subscribe to webhooks
$response = $sharpSports->webhooks()->subscribe($data);

// Get webhook logs
$logs = $sharpSports->webhooks()->getLogs();
```

## Model Classes

The SDK includes model classes for type-safe responses:

```php
use Bitmicrosys\SharpsportsPhp\Models\Book;

$books = $sharpSports->books()->list();

foreach ($books as $book) {
    echo $book->name; // BetMGM
    echo $book->abbr; // mg
    echo $book->isActive(); // true/false
    echo $book->requiresSdk(); // true/false
}
```

Available models:
- `Book`
- `Bettor`
- `BettorAccount`
- `BetSlip`

## Error Handling

The SDK throws `SharpsportsException` for API errors:

```php
use Bitmicrosys\SharpsportsPhp\SharpsportsException;

try {
    $books = $sharpSports->books()->list();
} catch (SharpsportsException $e) {
    echo "API Error: " . $e->getMessage();
    echo "Status Code: " . $e->getCode();
}
```

## Configuration Options

You can customize the HTTP client by passing options to the constructor:

```php
$sharpSports = new SharpSports('your_api_key', [
    'timeout' => 60,
    'connect_timeout' => 10,
    'headers' => [
        'User-Agent' => 'MyApp/1.0',
    ],
]);
```

## Known Issues

- Price API returns different response structures depending on parameters (single object vs array). Yeah, it's weird, but we handle it.
- Some endpoints need specific parameters or they'll yell at you
- Haven't tested everything extensively (who has time for that?)
- Probably other stuff I haven't found yet
